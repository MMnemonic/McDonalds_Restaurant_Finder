In this exercise, we extract all McDonalds restaurants within 50 km around
Madrid. 
For each store, we extract the attributes:

- Name
- Address
- Coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Phone number

We then save the information in a structured way; using a CSV file to do so. 

The geolocation coordinates are obtained using the Goggle Geolocation API.
